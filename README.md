## Research Interests

My research focuses on aquatic genetics and genomics, with an emphasis on
dissecting the genetic architecture of complex traits related to growth,
body shape, sex determination, and environmental adaptation in freshwater fish.

I have extensive experience in genomic studies of cyprinid species, particularly
bighead carp (*Hypophthalmichthys nobilis*), where I applied whole-genome
resequencing, GWAS/QTL mapping, and transcriptomic analyses to investigate
breeding-relevant traits. Building on this established research framework,
I am currently extending my work to European perch (*Perca fluviatilis*),
aiming to support genetic improvement and molecular breeding in emerging
aquaculture species.

By integrating population genomics, functional genomics, and high-throughput
sequencing technologies, my research bridges fundamental genomic discovery
and applied breeding programs in freshwater aquaculture.

Current research interests include:

• Genetic architecture of growth, body shape, and sex-related traits  
• Population genomics and whole-genome resequencing in freshwater fish  
• Genome-wide association studies and QTL mapping for breeding traits  
• Stress adaptation and immune regulation under environmental challenges  
• Molecular breeding and genomic-assisted selection
